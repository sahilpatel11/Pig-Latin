# Pig-Latin
This is a fun project which I just created while learning python.

Here, we ask the user to input the sentence and convert the sentence into pig latin form.
For eg,
"Pig Latin" converts to "igPay atinLay"

The rules are for converting into Pig Latin form are:
1. If the first letter of the word is vowel, then simply add "yay" at the end of the word.
   eg. "egg" -> "eggyay"
2.If the first letter of the word is not a vowel, then iterate through the word till you find the vowel,
  and take the cluster of consonants before the first vowel and place them at the end of word with "ay" succeeding them.
  eg: "Threshold" -> "esholdThray"


Hope you guys liked the project!
